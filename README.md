# Monkey barrel of userscripts

A userscript or two.

### [Goodreads high count giveaways](./goodreads-giveaway-high-count.user.js)

Removes First Reads giveaway offerings with a low number of books.
The higher the count, the not-as-bad chances of winning a review copy.

### [Goodreads giveaways arrow pager](./goodreads-arrow-pager.user.js)

Navigate the giveaway pages with left and right arrow keys instead of
having to click the pagination links.
