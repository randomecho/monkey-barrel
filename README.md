# Monkey barrel of userscripts

A userscript or two.

### [Goodreads high count giveaways](./goodreads-giveaway-high-count.user.js)

Removes First Reads giveaway offerings with a low number of books.
The higher the count, the not-as-bad chances of winning a review copy.

### [Goodreads giveaways arrow pager](./goodreads-arrow-pager.user.js)

Navigate the giveaway pages with left and right arrow keys instead of
having to click the pagination links.

### [Jira Hide unused bulk edit fields](./jira-bulk-edit-hide-unused-fields.user.js)

Hide fields from Bulk Edit screen that are not usually bulk edited
(including a whole bunch of custom fields). Also pre-selects the
"Edit Issues" option on the Step 2 of 4 page before Operation Details.

### [Jira Uncheck bulk edit emailer](./jira-uncheck-bulk-edit-mailer.user.js)

Uncheck the "Send mail for this update" on the Jira Bulk Edit screen.

### [Jira Workflow transitioner shortcuts](./jira-workflow-transitioner.user.js)
