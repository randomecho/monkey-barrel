# Monkey barrel of userscripts

A userscript or two.

### Goodreads

- [High count giveaways](./goodreads-giveaway-high-count.user.js)

 Removes First Reads giveaway offerings with a low number of books.
The higher the count, the not-as-bad chances of winning a review copy.

- [Giveaways arrow pager](./goodreads-arrow-pager.user.js)

 Navigate the giveaway pages with left and right arrow keys instead of
having to click the pagination links.

### Jira

- [Hide unused bulk edit fields](./jira-bulk-edit-hide-unused-fields.user.js)

 Hide fields from Bulk Edit screen that are not usually bulk edited
(including a whole bunch of custom fields). Also pre-selects the
"Edit Issues" option on the Step 2 of 4 page before Operation Details.

- [Uncheck bulk edit emailer](./jira-uncheck-bulk-edit-mailer.user.js)

 Uncheck the "Send mail for this update" on the Jira Bulk Edit screen.

- [Workflow transitioner shortcuts](./jira-workflow-transitioner.user.js)

 Add shortcut keys of `>` and `<` to trigger first two options in workflow transition.

### eBay

- [Relisting Resetter](./ebay-relisting-resetter.user.js)

 Reset fields more typical of plain month-long fixed-priced items.

### Misc

- [Projector Redirect back into timesheet](./projector-timesheet-redirect.user.js)

 Redirect to timesheet page after being logged out or on the dashboard.
That pesky screen about not being authorised is a nuisance asking to
be bounced away from.
